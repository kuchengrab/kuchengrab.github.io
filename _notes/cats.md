title: A note about cats
---

This is a second note with a poem with cats. 

Here's a link to a note that explains why it's important to [[move your body every day]].

> I like my pillow, my fancy bed,
>
> My cat tree and the bathroom sink.
>
> Each has its time and fills a need,
>
> but a box is best when I want to think.
